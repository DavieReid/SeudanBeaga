                Seudan Beaga Ltd was set up to meet a demand in Gaelic childcare in the city of Glasgow.  It has a unique edge compared to other childcare nurseries, as we work through the medium of Gaelic.  We use music and dance as a means of stimulation for the children with emphasis on Gaelic cultural activities.
            </p>
            <p>At the very heart of our Nursery is the Gaelic language which binds us as a community.  We would like all children, parents and staff to be so proud of the language and to work together to ensure it continues to develop in many different ways. </p>
            <p>
                As a Nursery community we want parents to participate in the life of the Nursery regardless of their own Gaelic language ability. We have an active Parental involvement, providing a lot of support to the Nursery in many different ways and in turn we support staff in their acquisition of Gaelic.
                We hope that every child and parent will contribute to the life of our nursery over the coming years and will feel happy, safe and proud of Seudan Beaga.
            </p>

                The Directors Liz Harrison and Christine Deeb (who is a fluent Gaelic speaker) refurbished Seudan Beaga internally and externally in 2014.
